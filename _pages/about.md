I am a PhD student in Computer Science in Tulane who is passionate about textual data research. My current academic endeavors center on causal inference with textual data, specifically focusing on estimating treatment effects using text. Additionally, I am profoundly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications, exploring how these advanced models can transform data interpretation and decision-making processes in computational linguistics and beyond.

Before joining Tulane, I completed my Master's degree in Data Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, where I first delved into NLP research, specifically in text classification and topic modeling. Prior to my studies at Stevens, I earned a B.S. in Statistics from Southern University of Science and Technology.
