This talk presents findings from our previous study, published in the ACM Web Conference 2023, which explores the predictive power of online reviews in indicating significant changes in K-12 school attributes such as socio-economic makeup and student test scores. The discussion includes how textual data from online reviews can serve as a proactive tool for educational administrators and policymakers, helping predict and prepare for demographic shifts and performance metrics changes.

To illustrate our methods and results, a detailed PowerPoint presentation has been prepared, which outlines the study's framework, the data analysis process, and key insights gained:
